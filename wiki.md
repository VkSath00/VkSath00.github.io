The **Seattle Supersonics** was a professional basketball team originated in Seattle, Washington. The team was a part of the *western conference* and consisted of many legendary star players throughout the years of its existence. The largest rival to the Seattle Sonics was the [Portland Trailblazers](https://www.nba.com/blazers/) who existed within the same conference. After 2008, the Sonics were sold and relocated to Oklahoma City where the team name changed to the [OKC Thunder](https://www.nba.com/thunder/).


## Notable Players
Some of the most famous players on the Seattle Supersonics are players like **Ray Allen**, **Kevin Durant**, **Gary Payton** and **Jack Sikma**, all who were inducted or will be inducted into the [Naismath Basketball Hall of Fame](https://www.hoophall.com/). Because of these players, Seattle was able to advance to the conference finals and was able to win a championship in 1979.

## Bring Back our Team!!!
Ever since the team was sold in 2008, there has been a hole in the hearts of Sonics fans throughout the state of Washington. Seattle is a basketball city at heart and would do *anything* to get a team back in their city. There has been some recent conversation regarding bringing back a few expansio teams into both conferences so that Seattle can have their team but that has not yet happened. The documentary [*Sonicsgate*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9Dp20ydm1E) dives into the controversy where the team had been taken from Seattle. 

### Location and Arena
The Sonics used to play at [**KeyArena**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Pledge_Arena) which is now called the *Climate Pledge Arena*. It is located in the heart of Seattle next to the space needle. Right before the transfer of the team, the Sonics played at the [**Tacoma Dome**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacoma_Dome). It still stands to this day.
